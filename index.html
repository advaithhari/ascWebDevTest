        Hi! My name is Advaith and I am a current Senior at the Peddie School in Hightstown NJ! I am really interested in Data Science and Web Development. Outside of Computer Science I enjoy biking, running, and hanging out with my friends.

            Peddie Book Exchange!

       <div class = "column">
        In my sophomore year, I created a platform to facilitate the buying and selling of textbooks for my school, developed in the summer of 2020 in collaboration with a few of my friends at Peddie. I was a full stack developer and created many of the functional features.

        SignIt!
    </div>
       <div class = "column" id="second"> 
        During my junior year at school, I successfully worked on a project for someone to use a camera to capture sign language from hand gestures, translate into text, and send computer generated voice messages to others. I used Tensorflow to create and run the model necessary to interpret and translate various sign language images.

    <div class = "column" id="third">
        I worked on this Capstone project in the summer of 2020 During All Star Code as the “buyers market” for a buyer to advertise what they want, and the sellers could bid on those advertisements. Two non-profit organizations are actively engaged in a pilot to advertise their needs to potential donors. I was the lead product manager and the lead developer in this project, and this was built in collaboration with my friends.
